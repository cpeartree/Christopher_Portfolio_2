                    <h5>BIOGRAPHY</h5>
                        <p>Petunia is a firm believer in natural and holistic approaches to health and wellness. She tries to minimize her family's exposure to toxins and chemicals and is conscious of her environmental impact. She's also passionate about instilling these values in her children and teaching them to appreciate the beauty of nature.</p>
                    <h5>GOALS</h5>
                        <p>Petunia's main goal is to provide a healthy and nurturing environment for her family. She wants to raise her children to be mindful, compassionate, and resilient individuals who care about the world around them. She's interested in using technology to facilitate this process but is wary of apps and websites that promote consumerism or have a negative impact on children's well-being.</p>
                    <h5>CHALLENGES</h5>
                        <p>Petunia often feels overwhelmed and anxious about the state of the world and the impact of climate change on her children's future. She's always looking for ways to educate herself and her family about environmental issues and how to live more sustainably.</p>
                    <h5>SCENARIO</h5>

                                    <p>Petunia is always looking for fun and educational activities to do with her child, Max. One day, while searching for weather-related educational tools, Lisa discovers Cato Weather on the App Store.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>Excited by the prospect of using an app to teach her child about the weather, Petunia downloads the app and opens it up. Upon opening the app, Petunia is presented with a simple and intuitive user interface that guides her through customizing the application experience for her child.</p>
                                </div>

                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <p>Petunia decides to explore the app with Max, and they learn about different weather systems by reading about the weather around them to playing fun mini-games that progress in complexity as Max ages/interacts with the application.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>After using the app for a while, Peruina is impressed with how engaging and educational it is. She plans to continue using the app regularly to teach Max about different weather systems and how they impact their daily lives.</p>

                            <p>The development of Cato Weather was a unique and innovative educational experience as it allowed us to think outside of the box when developing an application. Our focus was delivering a comprehensive and engaging weather education experience to children aged 3-13 years, the process allowed us to explore what is possible, and how it could be developed. With its possible range of interactive mini-games, learning experiences, and innovative AR mobile weather learning games, Cato Weather could offer a competitive advantage over its competitors, while its price point provides access to quality weather education that is affordable and accessible. </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Starting with a well-defined user persona was integral to our app development process as it provided the team with a deep understanding of the target audience's needs, behaviors, and preferences. This enabled us to create a highly tailored and engaging user experience, making our app more competitive and ultimately resulting in a successful product.</p>
